<h2>Sat Apr 09 2022</h2>

I've been going to the local university library for the past week or so. I've been working on a React course called
**_Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)_**. Which has been going well. I've gotten a bit bored at times. While taking the course.

Some of the things are just tedious and having access to certain things would have certainly made the course a bit easier to get through. Such as

### Things that would have made taking the course easier

<ul class="list-container">
    <div class="list-item-div">
    <li class="list-item"> - Having the current source code</li>
    <p class="list-item-sub-text">Which I eventually found but it wasn't easy to find on Google. Also the branches don't really match up to each section of the course.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item-div">
    <li class="list-item"> - Being able to compare the changed files within the project against my changed files.</li>
    <p class="list-item-sub-text"></p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item-div">
    <li class="list-item"> - Knowing to branch the project, during the challenge sections as to not disrupt the current working branch of the course.</li>
    <p class="list-item-sub-text"></p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item-div">
    <li class="list-item"> - Having a list of jargon and terms</li>
    <p class="list-item-sub-text">the insturctor doesn't make a point to highlight the terms and verbage that come up in the course.</p>
    </div>

</ul>
